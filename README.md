# 0x00. C - Hello, World

This repository contains the introductory project for learning C programming - the famous "Hello, World!" program. This project serves as a starting point for understanding the basics of C programming, compiling, and running C code.

## Description

In this project, you will find:

- A `0-hello_world` directory containing a simple C program, `0-hello_world.c`, that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- A `1-puts_recursion` directory containing a C program, `1-puts_recursion.c`, that prints a string using a recursive function.
- Other directories and files may be added as you progress through your C programming journey.

## Requirements

To compile and run the C programs in this repository, you will need a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can typically install it on Linux using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc
